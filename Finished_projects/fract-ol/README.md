# Fract-ol

A fractal generator built with the minilibx library. This is a project done for 42 Lisboa.

It computes the mandelbrot set and 7 different types of julia sets.

It allows for (almost) infinite zoom and moving around, as well as changing the julia seed.

Zoom follows mouse position (optional) and fractals can be drawn in colors or b&w.

## Usage/Examples

run make

./fractol m or ./fractol 1 for mandelbrot set

./fractol j <0-6> or ./fractol 2 <0-6> for julia set
