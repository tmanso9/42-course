# Fract-ol

A fractal generator built with the minilibx library. This is a project done for 42 Lisboa.

It computes the mandelbrot set and 7 different types of julia sets.

It allows for (almost) infinite zoom and moving around.

## Usage/Examples

run make

./fractol mandel or ./fractol 1 for mandelbrot set

./fractol julia <0-6> or ./fractol 2 <0-6> for julia set

While in the program:

wasd or arrows to move around

mouse wheel or + - to zoom in/out

r to reset view

m to change to mandelbrot, j to change to julia
